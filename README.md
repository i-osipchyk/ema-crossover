## Overview

The idea behind the project is that it is possible to use simple indicators and stock selection to identify setups, and get good Expected Value with the help of risk management and position sizing. The project focuses not only on the analysis, that will show if the idea is applicable or not, but potentially on building an application, that will automatically detect trading setups, monitor trading activity etc. 

First results show that this approach works better or more expensive stocks, where the presence of institutions is higher. Therefore, it may be a good idea to rely not only on statistics, but also on sentiment using LLMs.
